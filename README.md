# Fuel Efficiency Classification

## Overview
The **Fuel Efficiency** project leverages **Multinomial Logistic Regression** to classify vehicles into three fuel consumption categories: **Low, Medium, and High**. The model is designed to handle **multi-value classification** and is optimized for accuracy using the **softmax equation** and **argMax() function**.

## Features
- **Refactoring to Multi-Column Weights**: Enhances the logistic regression model by utilizing multiple weight columns for classification.
- **Classifying Continuous Values**: Categorizes fuel consumption into three distinct levels based on continuous input features.
- **Training a Multinomial Model**: Implements a multinomial logistic regression algorithm to predict fuel efficiency.
- **Conditional Probability Distribution**: Uses the **softmax function** to compute the probability distribution of each class.
- **Accuracy Measurement**: Implements **argMax()** to determine the most probable class and evaluates model performance using accuracy calculations.

## Results
- The model successfully categorizes vehicles into **Low, Medium, and High** fuel consumption groups.
- Achieves high classification accuracy based on test data.
- Performance insights provided via confusion matrices and accuracy scores.
